                    This was the final assignment to complete my studies at AIE. This overall project has taught me valuable experience about conceptualising an idea and continuously working on it to produce a workable game by the end of the subject. My Role throughout this project was Lead Programmer mainly programming our AI for the game and most of the core mechanics surrounding our player.

                <p>I was the sole programmer for our AI on this project, based on our timeframe for the project and the simplicity of what was needed for our AI, I opted for the FSM solution. There are two types of agents in our game, GPATROL(Threat to player) and the CIVILLIANS. Due to time constraints and issues popping up throughout the project that required my attention over the AI, i had to keep our AI really simple and keep down the required states for our agents, the Civillians consist of 3 basic States(Wander, Retreat, Alerted) and the GPatrol have 4 basic states as well(Wander, Retreat, Alerted, Pursue).</p>

            <div class="col-1-projects">
                <p>Using Unity’s inbuilt NavMesh solution one of the major issues that cropped up during the end of production was that the Agents kept diverting from the current path straight into a wall when there was no call to update the path. During debugging i had found that part of the issue lies within our NavMesh which got complex near the end and certain geometry pieces created jagged corners in which the AI would just choose to path to that corner as the shortest route. Either this was a nasty bug in our code or an underlying issue with some of the pathing with the inbuilt system Unity has, I managed to get a quick work-around up and running as this issue popped up within the last 2 weeks of production and a lot of my time was needed elsewhere. My solution was to add proxy renderers to our navmesh too smooth it out, and time how long it takes our agent to reach its destination, if the current time spent on the path was greater than the estimated time, then i reset the path. I did want to try and tackle the solution properly through using the “corners” array that unity provides and debug what would be causing the sudden change in path there but i just ran out of time.</p>

            <div class="col-1-projects">
                <p>Our game relied on objects in the game that the player can “possess” and “hide” in to interact with our NPC’s such as possessing an object and launching it towards an NPC or hiding in one and attracting them to that location to play a big scare animation. As the artists were pumping out a lot of assets for these items, it eventually became an annoying task for our designer to set each “item” up correctly. So I was tasked with making an editor script that checks each component on the current gameobject, and with the click of a button, adds all the required components and the correct values to that item. Also goes through the item’s renderer and makes sure its using the correct shader and textures required.</p>

            <div class="col-1-projects">
                <p>
                    This project was my very first implementation of a Finite State Machine, as well as A* Pathfinding. My overall goal for the project was to create a simulation with a few agents having certain roles that they fulfill and utilise A* for the pathing. These roles are:
                    <li><b>Default:</b> Default agents can only enter the Wander state and no other.</li>
                    <li><b>WellCollector:</b> Agents with this role are in charge of collecting water from the well when the storage is low.</li>
                    <li><b>Gatherer:</b> Agents with this role are in charge of gathering food from the bushes outside of town when storage is low.</li>
                    This project was a lot of fun to work on and gave me a lot of in depth knowledge on the inner workings of how a State Machine runs, and learning through the Dijkstra's algorithm and A Star was a huge learning curve for me and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

            <div class="col-1-projects">
                <p>My agents are using my first implementation of A* pathfinding. I setup my graph to load in a 64x64 texture, so each texture that is on screen is its own node. This made it super easy to create the Node map for the pathfinding, once each texture tile was placed, I simply looped through all my nodes in the graph and added a connection to the next node based on its position. I didn't really bother with creating a complicated map with varying costs, my map only consists of two walkable tiles which are the paths and grass tiles. The grass costs are high cost and paths are low cost. One of the few issues I did run into during this project that I didn't have time to properly debug before hand-in, was sometimes the paths created would be an odd diagonal pattern going between a low-cost node to a high-cost node continuously until it hits the designated end node, when it was clear that the path from the starting point to end point can just follow the low-cost tiles in a straight line. I believe this was a connection issue that i had incorrectly setup but it was a rare occurrence that popped up from time to time.</p>

            </header>

            <div class="col-1-projects">
                <p>There are six states that my Agents use, some are only accessible to Agents whose role matches the role that the state calls for, for example only the Agent with the role “WellCollector” can enter the state “CollectWaterState”. By default every Agent can enter the WanderState and just walk around the map, every step they take drains some value away from their personal “Hunger” and “Thirst”. Once those values hit zero the Agent heads to the storage to fill them back up, and draining what's in the storage. Whenever a storage hits zero the “Gatherers” and “WellCollectors” will travel to the designated spot to fetch some water/food and take it back to storage to replenish it. A very basic back and forth system simply to show my personal state machine off and its triggers. More states and Agent types like a “Wolf” would’ve been added but I decided to keep it simple and move onto other projects, as I felt I achieved the simple goal I had started with.</p>
